                  Our legal basis for processing the personal information
                  described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the type of
                  personal information and the specific context in which we
                  process it. However, the legal bases we typically rely on are
                  set out in the table below. We rely on our legitimate
                  interests as our legal basis only where those interests are
                  not overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your
                  consent or our processing is otherwise required or permitted
                  by law). If you have questions about the legal basis of how we
                  process your personal information, contact us at
                  privacy@trala.com.
