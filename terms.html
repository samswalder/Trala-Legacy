                  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                  enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an
                  arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
                  arbitration and describing your claim to legal@trala.com or
                  222 W Merchandise Mart Plaza, Ste. 1212 Trala, Chicago IL,
                  60654. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an
                  established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
                  involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not
                  inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to
                  JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration
                  Rules and procedures available at
                  http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all
                  other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version
                  of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures,
                  available at
                  http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
                  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by
                  calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to
                  arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral
                  forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay
                  JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and
                  cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Trala will pay them for you.
                  In addition, Trala will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing,
                  administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling
                  less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims
                  are frivolous. Likewise, Trala will not seek attorneys’ fees
                  and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the
                  claims are frivolous.

                  where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any

                  which the award is based, including the calculation of any
                  damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to
                  award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of
                  law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and

                  Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1
                  above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
                  damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement

                  arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
                  subject to very limited review.
